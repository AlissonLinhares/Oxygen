### About
<p style="text-indent: 2em;" align="justify">
Oxygen is an object-oriented isometric HTML5 game engine created by my brother and me, just for fun, in our free time. The engine is highly portable and relatively fast for a JavaScript application.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;" align="justify">
The main advantage of this project is its portability. The engine is capable of running on almost all modern browsers and input devices. Moreover, all the underlying math was specifically tailored for strategy and classic action RPG games.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;" align="justify">
The current version is actually the second generation of the engine. The first one used a WebGL canvas to render images instead of Canvas2D. We decided to recreate the entire rendering mechanism for compatibility reasons. WebGL is still experimental and doesn't run on all devices. Someday, we intend to give WebGL another chance and return to the old rendering algorithmâ€”but for now, Canvas2D is simple, portable, and good enough for what we want to do.
